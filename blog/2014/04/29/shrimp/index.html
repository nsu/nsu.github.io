<p>Ugh, I wish it were that simple, but it really isn&rsquo;t, so I&rsquo;m going to try to take a crack at it. To start I&rsquo;ll assume we&rsquo;re talking about the issues of homosexuality and kosher food laws in Christianity. I&rsquo;m going to pretty much entirely ignore Judaism, since we don’t have a lot of bigoted Jews demonstrating against homosexuality in America. So, while both shellfish and homosexuality are pretty sinful in the Old Testament, the modern significance is really much more heavily geared towards Christianity than Rabbinic Judaism. If we can agree that we&rsquo;re talking about Christianity in general, then what asking about in particular is the role of the Torah. Obviously the Bible, as a compilation of a great variety of Jewish and Christian texts doesn’t offer one monolithic view on this issue, and delving into reformation theology complicates things further. So for our purposes I’m going to try to focus on the foundations of Christianity by looking at the New Testament gospels and the letters of Paul.</p>

<p>I wanted to sort of ignore the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Marl, Luke) because I don’t think there’s time for them here, but I can’t do that entirely because I think two particular sections are really interesting and passing them by would be a loss. First, the antitheses in Matthew, chapter 5, particularly verses 27-28. “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” Here and throughout the antitheses Jesus re-establishes the Jewish law as the foundation of faith in God. He specifically points to sexual proclivities as an affront to God, and says that even the desire to commit improper sex acts (which would have certainly included homosexuality) is a violation of the law.</p>

<p>The other verse I’d like to look at is Mark 2:27, “Then he said to them, ‘The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.’” This is a different gospel and a different path. I’m not going to pretend that Matt and Mark agree on everything. But I think this is an important example of ways in which the laws are undermined by Christ rather than upheld, even in the synoptics. The message is that faith and service to God aren’t proven by your blind adherence to earthly laws, but rather your desire to serve and your faith in God. In the woes to the Pharisees, Jesus calls out Jewish leaders as being hypocrites because they follow the letter of the law without faith in their hearts. So things like kosher food laws, and jewish purification rituals and cultic sacrifice are subverted in Mark. Are rules against homosexuality? Maybe. I find it less likely, but maybe.</p>

<p>Okay so that’s a short look at the synoptics. Let’s look at John real quick?</p>

<p>In John, it appears that the Jewish law is completely nullified by the salvific power manifested in the Christ. In John, Jesus says that “no one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6) In John’s model of Christianity (and this is a bit of a radical interpretation on my part) we explicitly enter a post-resurrection reality where it no longer matters if you bang dudes or eat shrimp. What counts here is is your knowledge that Christ and the Father are one. It’s sort of like Islam here, where you need to know the status of God and submit to his power with the added bonus that the previous covenants are all voided by this new one. But the problem with using this as a basis for your understanding of Christianit is that’s it’s fairly detached from the realities of life. John is really concerned more with a philosophical soteriology than with the practical life of a Christian believer, so I don’t think this is an end-all to the Christian message, especially in the face of the Synoptics and Paul</p>

<p>If we want to get a better look at what a Christian is to do in their lives, we should look at the apostle Paul whose letters make up a good portion of the New Testament. His letters focus on specific issues and occasions in the early Christian churches and attempted to provide theological responses and resolutions. Right off the bat let’s establish three things. One: Paul unambiguously identified himself as the apostle to the gentiles (Romans 11:13). Two: Most modern Christians are gentiles rather than converted Jews. Three: Therefore Paul’s writings are relevant to the majority of modern Christians. And what does Paul have to say about Torah? Don’t keep it if you’re a Gentile. In Galatians Paul is obviously angry about Jewish Jesus followers who have been telling Gentiles in the movement that they need to be circumcised in order to follow Jesus “Listen! I, Paul, am telling you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you” (Gal 5:2). It doesn’t get more clear than that. For a more subtle, but expansive tractate, you can turn to Romans. Here Paul lays out the parallel but distinct covenants that Jews and Christians have entreated into with God.The message is powerful throughout Paul: Gentiles, having Jesus, are now exempted from Torah.</p>

<p>Alright. So shellfish with your boyfriend: cool for Christ? Not really.</p>

<p>We see in 1 &amp; 2 Corinthians, Philemon and elsewhere a distinct Pauline desire for people to fit into specific societal roles. In 1 Corinthians women are encouraged to wear veils in church and keep their hair long (1 Cor 11), that a man should not sleep with his stepmother (1 Cor 5), and a general detest for the sexual immorality that made Corinth famous. Likewise, in Philemon, Paul returns an escaped slave to his master, both of whom are Christian. The message is that escaping from your socially mandated role is inappropriate. Stay in bondage like a “good slave”, keep your hair long like a “good woman”, don’t have kinky sex like a “good human”. I can’t help but believe that homosexuality falls into this category of stepping outside of your proper role for early Christians. As an aside, Seneca does a good bit on homosexuality  where he explains that what makes homosexuality wrong is that it makes a man submit to the penetration of another man, and thus sacrifices his manliness. This would be offensive to Paul as well, since relinquishing your manliness is a relinquishment of your God-given role.</p>

<p>I would like to offer up an explanation that might revive homosexuality in the view of Paul’s message. The discouragement of deviant sex acts is in part a response to a larger issue that faced early Christians. We have historical documents accusing Christians of just about every depraved act you can think of, from eating babies to incestuous orgies. This is a serious problem for a nascent religion. Paul’s response to this problem is to encourage Christians to be as good and righteous as possible. If Christians are remaining celibate, feeding the poor, going to work and generally being upstanding members of the community, then these accusations might fall flat. But if Christians are having sex with their stepmothers, running away from their masters and refusing to have sex with their husbands, then they’re going to look odd, and people are going to start asking what else they do behind closed doors. Paul wants to avoid this as much as possible. From this perspective, Paul wouldn’t command believers to avoid homosexuality in particular, but rather, deviant sexuality in general. So then what if our standards for deviancy change? If homosexuality can become an accepted behavior, then it doesn’t matter if you’re gay or not.</p>

<p>This is a slightly empty consolation, however. First of all, Christians, especially in America represent a powerful majority. Christianity is no longer a tiny messianic Jewish movement. For the broad social opinion to change, it has to change among Christians, they can’t rely on following the trends of a larger group in which they stand. They set the trends. Secondly, this means that Christianity is permanently socially conservative. By only following accepted social norms, Christianity would define itself as socially conservative by default on all issues of sexuality. This permanent attack on sexual deviancy would represent a harsh trajectory for the church, and a disappointing future for progressive Christians.</p>

<p>The point underlying all of this is that Christianity is complicated; theology can’t be discounted by word count alone. Those of us who live in Western society owe it to ourselves to take Christianity seriously on its own terms, not because it is necessarily correct, but because it is the philosophical water that we swim in.</p>
